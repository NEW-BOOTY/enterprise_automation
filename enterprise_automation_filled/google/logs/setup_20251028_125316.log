==> Caveats
Python is installed as
  /usr/local/bin/python3.11

Unversioned and major-versioned symlinks `python`, `python3`, `python-config`, `python3-config`, `pip`, `pip3`, etc. pointing to
`python3.11`, `python3.11-config`, `pip3.11` etc., respectively, are installed into
  /usr/local/opt/python@3.11/libexec/bin

You can install Python packages with
  pip3.11 install <package>
They will install into the site-package directory
  /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages

`idle3.11` requires tkinter, which is available separately:
  brew install python-tk@3.11

gdbm (`dbm.gnu`) is no longer included in this formula, but it is available separately:
  brew install python-gdbm@3.11
`dbm.ndbm` changed database backends in Homebrew Python 3.11.
If you need to read a database from a previous Homebrew Python created via `dbm.ndbm`,
you'll need to read your database using the older version of Homebrew Python and convert to another format.
`dbm` still defaults to `dbm.gnu` when it is installed.

If you do not need a specific version of Python, and always want Homebrew's `python3` in your PATH:
  brew install python3
